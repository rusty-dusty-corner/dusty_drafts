# Rust Optics Pattern Implementation Analysis

## Overview
This code demonstrates the implementation of functional optics (lenses and prisms) in Rust, which is a powerful pattern for working with immutable data structures.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Optics Pattern
- Lenses: Allow safe access and modification of nested data structures
- Prisms: Handle sum types (enums) in a functional way

### 2. Main Components

#### StructuresUser {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    address: Address,
}

Address {
    city: String,
    street: String,
}

#### Traitstrait Lens<S, A> {
    fn get<'a>(&self, source: &'a S) -> &'a A;
    fn set(self, source: S, value: A) -> S;
}

trait Prism<S, A> {
    fn preview<'a>(&self, source: &'a S) -> Option<&'a A>;
    fn review(self, value: A) -> S;
}
